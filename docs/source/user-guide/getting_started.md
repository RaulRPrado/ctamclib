# Getting Started

The usage of simtools require the installation of the simtools package, its dependencies,
and the setting of environment variables to connect to the model database.

## Model Database Access

Simulation model parameters are stored in a MongoDB-type database.
Many simtools applications depend on access to this database.

:::{note}
Ask one of the developers for the credentials to access the database.
:::

Credentials for database access are passed on to simtools applications using environmental variables stored
in a file named `.env`.
Copy the template file [.env_template](https://github.com/gammasim/simtools/blob/main/.env_template)
to a new file named `.env` and update it with the credentials.

## Installation for Users

:::{warning}
simtools is under rapid development and not ready for production use.
The following setup is recommended for users who want to test the software.
:::

There are three options to install simtools for users:

- using pip
- using git and pip
- download a docker container with all software installed

All simtools applications are available as command-line tools.
Note the naming of the tool, starting with `simtools-` followed by the application name.
See {ref}`Applications` for more details.

Note to update the `.env` file with the credentials for database access (see [Model Database Access]).

(pipinstallation)=

### Pip Installation

:::{warning}
The pip-installation of simtools provides limited functionality only
and is not as well tests as the conda/mamba installation.
:::

Prepare a python environment (in this example for python version 3.11):

```console
mamba create --name simtools-prod python=3.11
mamba activate simtools-prod
```

Use pip to install simtools and its dependencies:

```console
pip install gammasimtools
```

The pip installation method requires to install CORSIKA/sim_telarray separately, see [CorsikaSimTelarrayInstallation].

(gitinstallation)=

### Git Installation

Install simtools directly from the GitHub repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/gammasim/simtools.git
cd simtools
pip install .
```

The git installation method requires to install CORSIKA/sim_telarray separately, see [CorsikaSimTelarrayInstallation].

(dockerinstallation)=

### Container Installation

The container `simtools-prod` includes all software required to run simtools applications:

- corsika and sim_telarray
- python packages required by simtools
- simtools

Containers are tested with docker, podman, and apptainer. Replace `docker` with the container system of your choice.

To run bash in the [simtools-prod container](https://github.com/gammasim/simtools/pkgs/container/simtools-prod):

```console
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env \
    -v "$(pwd):/workdir/external" \
    ghcr.io/gammasim/simtools-prod:latest bash
```

In the container, simtools applications are installed and can be called directly (e.g., `simtools-convert-geo-coordinates-of-array-elements -h`).
This example uses the docker syntax to mount your local directory.

The following example runs an application inside the container and writes the output into a directory of the local files system,

```console
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env \
    -v "$(pwd):/workdir/external" \
    ghcr.io/gammasim/simtools-prod:latest \
    simtools-convert-geo-coordinates-of-array-elements \
    --array_element_list ./simtools/tests/resources/telescope_positions-North-utm.ecsv \
    --export corsika --use_corsika_telescope_height \
    --output_path /workdir/external/
```

(installationfordevelopers)=

## Installation for Developers

Developers install simtools directly from the GitHub repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/gammasim/simtools.git
cd simtools
```

Create a conda/mamba virtual environment with the simtools dependencies installed:

```console
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate simtools-dev
pip install -e .
```

(corsikasimtelarrayinstallation)=

## Installation of CORSIKA and sim_telarray

CORSIKA and sim_telarray are external tools to simtools and are required dependencies for many applications.
Recommended is to use the Docker environment, see description in [Docker Environment for Developers](docker_files.md).

For a non-Docker setup, follow the instruction provided by the CORSIKA/sim_telarray authors for installation.
CTA users can download both packages from the [sim_telarray web page](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/CTA/MC/Software/Testing/)
(CTA password applies) and install the package with:

```console
tar -czf corsika7.7_simtelarray.tar.gz
./build_all prod5 qgs2 gsl
```

The environmental variable `$SIMTOOLS_SIMTEL_PATH` should point towards the CORSIKA/sim_telarray installation
(recommended to include it in the .env file with all other environment variables).

Test your complete installation following the instructions in {ref}`this section <TestingInstallation>`.

## Docker Environment for Developers

Docker containers are available for developers, see the [Docker file directory](https://github.com/gammasim/simtools/tree/main/docker).

Images are available from the [GitHub container registry](https://github.com/gammasim/simtools/pkgs/container/simtools-dev) for the latest simtools versions, for each pull request, and the current main branch.

The docker container has python packages, CORSIKA, and sim_telarray pre-installed.
Setting up a system to run simtools applications or tests should be a matter of minutes.

Install Docker and start the Docker application (see
[Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).

Clone simtools from GitHub into a directory `external/simtools`:

```bash
# create a working directory
mkdir external
# clone simtools repository
git clone https://github.com/gammasim/simtools.git external/simtools
```

Start up a container (the image will be downloaded, if it is not available in your environment):

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)/external:/workdir/external" \
    ghcr.io/gammasim/simtools-dev:latest \
    bash -c "source /workdir/env/bin/activate && cd /workdir/external/simtools && pip install -e . && bash"
```

The container includes a CORSIKA and sim_telarray installation;
the environmental variable `$SIMTOOLS_SIMTEL_PATH` and those for the database access are automatically set
(if variables are set correctly in the `.env` file).

(testinginstallation)=

## Testing your installation

Test the simtools installation the docker image by running the unit tests:

```console
pytest tests/unit_tests/
```

Test the simtools plus CORSIKA/sim_telarray installation by running the integration tests:

```console
pytest --no-cov tests/integration_tests/
```
