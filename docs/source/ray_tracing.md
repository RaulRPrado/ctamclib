# Ray Tracing

The Ray Tracing module (and its main class RayTracing) handles ray tracing simulations, analysis and I/O.
It receives as input a Telescope Model (see {ref}`telescope_model <telescope_model>`) and few more physical parameters (zenith angle, etc).
At the moment, the RayTracing class includes the whole dish mode (default one) and a single mirror mode.
